# WatObs: Access Water Observation Data

This Python package gives you convenient access to water observation data with a bring-your-own-api-key concept. 

## Data overview

* DHI satellite [altimetry data](https://altimetry.dhigroup.com/purchase)
* Ocean Observations from [Danish Meteorological Institute](https://confluence.govcloud.dk/display/FDAPI/Danish+Meteorological+Institute+-+Open+Data)

## Satellite altimetry data 

Altimetry data (water level, significant wave height and wind speed) obtained from satellites are very useful for validation of models as the data are available globally since 1985 and up to 12 hour before now. 

DHI has an [altimetry portal](https://altimetry.dhigroup.com/purchase) with an [api](https://altimetry-shop-data-api.dhigroup.com/apidoc) where you can download the data.
